Execute a single TCR (Test-Commit-Revert) iteration for a one-off task.

### TCR Loop (Single Iteration)

1. **Preflight**: Verify clean tree, tests pass
2. **Red (Test)**: Write failing test
3. **Green (Implement)**: Write minimal code to pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests
   - **Pass**: Commit "Step: <description>"
   - **Fail once**: Attempt one fix
   - **Fail again**: Revert (`git checkout .`) and report failure

**NOTE:** Always use `edit` tool for targetted edits, unless you are creating a new file from scratch. NEVER overwrite existing files in a large sweep.
