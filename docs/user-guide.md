# User Guide: The Architect in the Machine

Welcome to the **Gemini CLI Opinionated Framework**. This guide is based on the original design philosophy ("The Architect in the Machine") and explains how to use the framework to achieve a high-velocity, AI-assisted development workflow.

The framework is not just a set of scripts; it is a principled system designed to take you from ideation to execution at the fastest responsible speed, without sacrificing safety or maintainability.

## 🧠 Principles of Effective AI-Assisted Work

The most pressing limitation of modern LLMs is context saturation. When you work on a single project for a long time, the model can lose track of important details, leading to hallucinations or drift.

This framework solves this problem by enforcing three core principles:

1.  **The important things should be made explicit:** We keep track of everything important in Markdown files. Ideas are committed to `plans/`, research is summarized in `research/`, and all changes are logged in the `journal/`. This physical "long-term memory" prevents the agent from forgetting context.
2.  **Resist the urge to guess:** We favor explicit commands over implicit actions. If you want the model to make a plan, you use the `/plan` command, which invokes a carefully crafted workflow rather than relying on the agent's default behavior.
3.  **Delegate, delegate, delegate:** We use specialized sub-agents (`planner`, `researcher`, `writer`, `reviewer`, `coder`). These agents run complex, multi-step tasks in private contexts, preventing their internal reasoning (e.g., browsing 20 web pages) from polluting the main session's context window.

## 🔍 Phase 1: Discovery & Audit

The most critical phase of any project occurs before you write a single line of code. This phase uses read-only commands to gather information safely.

### `/research`

Your tool for deep domain exploration.
- **How it works:** Gathers documentation and synthesizes it into `research/` reports.

### `/debug`

Your primary tool for forensic, scientific investigation.

- **How it works:** When a bug is detected, the `/debug` command implements a principled approach to problem-solving using the specialized `debugger` subagent. It moves through four distinct phases: Context Analysis, Hypothesis Formulation, Isolated Testing on a temporary branch (`debug/hyp-*`), and finally a Synthesis of the findings into a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** report.
- **Why it works:** It forces the agent to identify the root cause *before* attempting a fix, preventing "guess-and-check" coding that can lead to regressions.

### `/brainstorm`

Your tool for interactive, critical-thinking sessions.

- **How it works:** You present an idea, problem, or architectural choice. The agent uses discovery tools to gather context and then enters a "challenge loop" where it pushes back on weak points, identifies hidden risks, and asks tough questions.
- **Why it works:** It forces you to defend your ideas and refine them *before* they even reach the planning stage, ensuring higher-quality strategies.

---

## 🌉 Phase 2: Strategy & Planning

Once you have gathered discovery artifacts, you must synthesize them into an actionable strategy.

### `/plan`

Your tool for internal strategy and architectural design.

- **How it works:** The `planner` subagent conducts a thorough analysis of your codebase and journal. After clarifying the goal with you interactively, it produces a comprehensive Markdown plan in the `plans/` directory.
- **Crucial Rule:** The `/plan` command *never* executes the code. It maps the territory and provides a step-by-step execution roadmap for you to approve first.

### `/learn`

Your tool for mastering new technologies and codifying them into project skills.

- **How it works:** Implements a "Grounded Learning" philosophy through a 4-phase lifecycle using the `learner` subagent:
    1.  **Environment Audit:** Automatically detects if the library is already installed or has local integration points.
...
- **Why it works:** It transforms ephemeral research into a permanent, machine-readable knowledge base that future agents can autonomously activate.

### `/onboard`

Your tool for rapid project orientation.

- **How it works:** Provides a high-signal overview of the repository's architecture, standards, and current state. 
- **Why it works:** It ensures that you (and the agent) are always aligned with the project's unique conventions before starting a session.

---

## 🚀 Phase 3: Execution & Implementation

Once you have a solid strategy in `plans/`, you can move into execution. These commands eliminate the friction of context-switching between your IDE and terminal.

### `/issues`

Your gateway to GitHub.

- **How it works:** Interfaces with the GitHub CLI to analyze open issues and recommend what to tackle next based on strategic impact.


### `/scaffold`

Your tool for project initialization.

- **How it works:** Scaffolds new components or entire projects using modern, standard tooling (TS, Python, Rust, etc.) and integrates the framework's standards and `makefile` from the start.

### `/task`

Your roadmap manager.

- **How it works:** Manages a living `TASKS.md` document **exclusively** via the `.gemini/scripts/task.py` utility. Use it to `create` new tasks, `start` work on existing ones, `report` on priorities, or `archive` completed tasks.
- **Why it works:** By treating the roadmap as a machine-managed artifact, the framework ensures consistent formatting, automated ID generation (e.g., `G.4`), and a clear transition from `Todo` to `Archive` that aligns with the agent's turn lifecycle.
- **Workflow Example:**
    1.  `python .gemini/scripts/task.py add --label "New Feature" --description "..." --category "Logic"`
    2.  `python .gemini/scripts/task.py start --task-id L.1` (marks as In Progress)
    3.  Perform work via `/task work` (TCR loop).
    4.  `python .gemini/scripts/task.py archive --task-id L.1` (moves to Archive)

### `/commit`
...
## 🌲 The Tier Protocol (Semantic Routing)

To balance speed, cost, and architectural integrity, the framework implements a **Tier Protocol** for model routing. This is configured in `.gemini/settings.json`.

### The "Thinking" Tier (Clever/Pro)
Specialized agents that require high-reasoning and deep causal analysis are mapped to **`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`**.
- **`planner`**: For architectural design and strategy.
- **`debugger`**: For forensic root-cause analysis.
- **`learner`**: For mastering new technologies without hallucinations.
- **`reviewer`**: For critical editorial audits.

### The "Execution" Tier (Dumber/Lite)
Agents optimized for high-volume drafting and discovery are mapped to **`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`**.
- **`writer`**: For section-by-section drafting.
- **`researcher`**: For rapid information gathering.

## 🔄 A Full Feature Development Walkthrough


- **How it works:** Instead of monolithic "WIP" commits, this command analyzes your `git diff` and logically groups modifications into cohesive units. It proposes a series of atomic, Conventional Commits (e.g., separating a feature update from a documentation tweak) for your approval.

### `/release`

Automates the deployment process.

- **How it works:** Verifies workspace integrity (clean git tree, passing tests via `make`), analyzes commit history to propose the next version bump, drafts a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and publishes the final tag to GitHub.

## 🔄 A Full Feature Development Walkthrough

A complete, principled development cycle follows the **Discovery -> Plan -> Execute** lifecycle.

### **Step 1: Discovery with `/research`, `/maintenance`, or `/review`**

Before acting, you must gather context. For example, if you are integrating a new authentication library, you start by researching the technical requirements.

- The `researcher` subagent gathers documentation and synthesizes it into `research/auth-library-deep-dive.md`.
- Alternatively, you might run `/maintenance` to audit the codebase or `/review` to audit a document. In all cases, a read-only artifact is produced.

### **Step 2: Strategy with `/plan`**

Once you understand the requirements, you trigger the `/plan` command.

- The `planner` subagent analyzes the codebase and generates `plans/implement-auth.md`, mapping out the specific architectural changes and testing strategy.

### **Step 3: Execute with `/task work`**

The approved plan is linked to a task. You trigger the execution:

- **Pre-flight:** The agent verifies the tree is clean on `main`.
- **Isolation:** A `feature/auth-integration` branch is created.
- **Loop (Red-Green-Verify):**
    The `/task` orchestrator breaks the plan into granular steps. For each step, it delegates to the **`coder` subagent**:
    1.  **`coder`** writes a failing `test_auth_logic.py` based on the step.
    2.  **`coder`** implements the minimal logic to pass.
    3.  **`coder`** verifies with `make test`. If successful, the orchestrator commits the step.
    4.  If it fails, the orchestrator reverts the step and reports the failure.
    5.  The loop repeats for every granular step defined in the plan.

### **Step 4: Review & Integrate**

After all steps pass, the agent presents the final work. Upon your approval, it merges back to `main` and cleans up the feature branch.

### Step 5: Document & Release with `/document` & `/release`

Finally, use `/document` to update the technical documentation and `/release` to publish the new version.
## 🔍 Walkthrough: Solving a Bug with `/debug`

When a bug is detected, the `/debug` command ensures a scientific resolution using the specialized `debugger` subagent:

1.  **Analyze Context:** The agent gathers all relevant logs and context.
...
2.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** The agent proposes a root cause hypothesis (e.g., "The auth token is not being correctly passed to the header").
3.  **Isolate & Test:** The agent creates a temporary branch `debug/hyp-auth-token`. It implements a minimal reproduction script or logging.
4.  **RCA Synthesis:** Once confirmed, the agent generates a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** report. This report is used as the basis for the subsequent `/task work` to implement the fix on a feature branch.

## ✍️ Maintaining your Journal

The framework's most powerful feature is its automated audit trail. This is enforced by a **timestamp-based pre-commit hook** that ensures your code never gets ahead of your documentation.

### The Rule of Temporal Consistency

Every code change must be documented in `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. If you modify a file at 10:00 AM, you must have a journal entry with a timestamp of 10:00 AM or later before you can commit.

### Using the Journal Tool

To simplify this, the framework includes a dedicated script. Always use it instead of manual editing:

```bash
python3 .gemini/scripts/journal.py "Brief description of your work"
```

This tool automatically:
1.  Detects the current date and finds/creates the correct journal file.
2.  Generates a precise ISO timestamp.
3.  Appends the entry in the standard `[timestamp] - description` format.

By following this discipline, you ensure that the AI agent always has an up-to-date "long-term memory" to draw from in future sessions.

## ✍️ The Content Creation Workflow

Beyond code, this framework excels at generating high-quality technical content through a principled, multi-stage pipeline.

### `/draft`

Your primary tool for long-form technical writing.

- **How it works:** Instead of generating a single large blob of text, the `/draft` command follows a strict 6-phase workflow: Context Gathering (from `research/` or `plans/`), Title & Metadata Selection, Outline Creation (aligned with the Style Guide), Initialization of the file, Section-by-Section Drafting (using the `writer` subagent), and finally, a Conclusion with next steps.
- **Why it works:** It forces structural integrity and prevents the "AI-ish" monotone by building the document incrementally based on project-specific research.

### `/review`

Your tool for deep, multi-phase editorial audits.

- **How it works:** Replaces the legacy `/revise` command with a non-destructive, evidence-based reporting workflow. It uses the `reviewer` subagent to audit a file in three distinct phases:
    1.  **Structural Audit:** Narrative arc and header hierarchy.
    2.  **Substance Audit:** Concreteness and technical depth.
    3.  **Linguistic Audit:** Removing "AI-isms" and polishing the prose.
- **Why it works:** It produces a sidecar `<filename>.review.md` report instead of modifying the original file, allowing you to choose which suggestions to apply during the next `/draft` or `/task work` iteration.

## ⚙️ Background Tasks & Maintenance


The real magic of AI-assisted development is what happens when you're not looking or when dealing with technical debt.

### `/cron`

Your background automation layer.

- **How it works:** Uses the `cron.toml` file to define scheduled tasks via systemd user timers. You can schedule natural language prompts (e.g., "Scour the web for new developments in X") to run overnight, ensuring your knowledge base is fresh by morning.

### `/maintenance`

Your defense against context rot.

- **How it works:** Performs a comprehensive, read-only audit of the codebase to identify technical debt, outdated implementations, or documentation gaps using the `codebase_investigator`. It generates a "Maintenance Report Card" in the `research/` directory.
- **Why it works:** It separates the audit from the implementation, ensuring the codebase remains a clean environment. After an audit, use the `/plan` command to safely execute the suggested improvements.
