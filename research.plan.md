# Research Plan: How to solve P vs NP

- [x] 1. **Foundations**: Define P, NP, NP-Complete, and the formal problem statement (Turing machines, decision problems).
- [x] 2. **The Barriers**: Investigate why past attempts have failed (Relativization, Natural Proofs, Algebrization).
- [x] 3. **Current Approaches**: Research the current state-of-the-art attempts (e.g., Geometric Complexity Theory, advanced circuit lower bounds).
- [x] 4. **Implications & Consensus**: What happens if P=NP or P!=NP, and what do experts currently believe (surveys like Gasarch).
- [x] 5. **Workspace Context**: Check if this theoretical problem has any practical implications in our current codebase (e.g., usage of SAT solvers or heuristics for NP-hard problems).
