## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Timestamp-Based Journal Validation:** Implemented an automated check in the `pre-commit.py` hook that parses the latest journal entry's ISO timestamp and compares it against the modification times of any changed files.
- **Journal Script Tooling:** Added `.gemini/scripts/journal.py`, a simple utility script for correctly formatting and appending new journal entries.
- **Hook Installation Check:** Added an automatic check to the `welcome.py` script that alerts the user if the project's pre-commit hooks are not installed.

### Changed
- **Improved Hook Robustness:** Enhanced the pre-commit script to correctly ignore the journal file's own modification when checking for pending documentation updates.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Consolidated Lifecycle Hooks:** Integrated all project-specific lifecycle hooks into a single, efficient `pre-commit.py` script.
- **Enabled Gemini Lifecycle Hooks:** Enabled the Gemini CLI framework's automatic hook execution system in `.gemini/settings.json`.
- **Improved Hook Robustness:** Enhanced the pre-commit script to correctly detect staged files and automatically set the executable bit for required scripts.
- **Makefile Integration:** Added a new `install-hooks` target to the `makefile` for easy setup of the project's hook system.

### Changed
- **Refactored Hook System:** Simplified the hook architecture by moving from individual task-based hooks to a unified validation strategy.
- **Enhanced Hook Feedback:** Improved error messages and output formatting for all lifecycle hooks.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Notification Hook:** Implemented a new `AfterAgent` hook (`notify.py`) that sends a desktop notification using `notify-send` and plays a system "ping" sound (via `paplay`) when the agent completes its turn.
- **Hook Robustness:** Improved project name detection in notifications by correctly identifying the git repository root.

### Changed
- **Hook Sequencing:** Refined the `AfterAgent` hook block to be sequential, ensuring notifications only trigger if preceding validation hooks (like `make` or `journal`) return an `allow` decision.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Hypothesis-Driven Debugging:** Refactored the `/debug` command and `debugger` agent to implement a scientific, hypothesis-driven workflow. Includes status analysis, hypothesis formulation with user approval, and isolated testing in temporary `debug/hyp-*` branches.
- **Content:** Added a new blog post draft "Revenge of the Test-Driven Nerds" to the `drafts/` directory.

### Changed
- **Command Rename:** Renamed the `.gemini/commands/docs.toml` to `.gemini/commands/document.toml` for better semantic clarity.
- **Settings:** Removed the experimental `plan` setting from `.gemini/settings.json`.
- **Documentation:** Enhanced installation and setup documentation with detailed project scaffolding and integration steps.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Implemented a strict TCR (Test-Commit-Revert) protocol for the `/task work` command, enforcing Red-Green-Refactor development cycles on dedicated feature branches.

### Changed
- Refined `install.sh` to protect project scaffolding files (e.g., `README.md`, `TASKS.md`) from being overwritten while ensuring core framework files are always updated.
- Updated documentation and roadmap to reflect the new workflow improvements.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Unified `install.sh` script that handles both initial project bootstrapping and non-destructive framework updates/integrations in existing repositories.
- Automatic git environment validation (clean tree requirement) and post-install commits to `install.sh`.
- Interactive summary and confirmation of proposed changes (created vs. updated files) in the installer.
- **Documentation Suite:** Integrated MkDocs with Material theme and a comprehensive User Guide based on "The Architect in the Machine" philosophy.
- **Operational Safety:** Conditional `make` and journal hook execution based on file modification times.
- **Performance:** Simplified `/onboard` command using direct file analysis instead of sub-agents.
- **Refinement:** Strictly enforced non-execution mandate for `/plan` output.

### Removed
- `add-gemini.sh` script (its logic is now integrated into the unified `install.sh`).

### Changed
- Streamlined `README.md` with a single, unified "Quick Start" command for all use cases.
