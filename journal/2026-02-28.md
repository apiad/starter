- Consolidated `/task/*` commands (`create`, `work`, `report`, `update`) into a single `/task` command in `.gemini/commands/task.toml`.
- Added a new `/scaffold` command to initialize new projects with modern standard practices and tooling.
- Refactored the `/research` command into a robust 3-phase workflow using specialized `researcher` and `reporter` subagents.
- Rewrote the `README.md` to explain the opinionated framework, the agent's behavior, hooks, commands, journaling, and the project initialization workflow.
- Refactored the hook system: centralized shared logic into `.gemini/hooks/utils.py` and added PEP 257 docstrings to all hooks.
- Released version 0.4.0, documenting the hook system refactor and internal improvements.
- Added a new /issues command to manage project issues with GitHub CLI.
