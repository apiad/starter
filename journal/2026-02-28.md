- Consolidated `/task/*` commands (`create`, `work`, `report`, `update`) into a single `/task` command in `.gemini/commands/task.toml`.
- Added a new `/scaffold` command to initialize new projects with modern standard practices and tooling.
- Refactored the `/research` command into a robust 3-phase workflow using specialized `researcher` and `reporter` subagents.
