prompt = """
Please analyze all current uncommitted changes (including untracked files).
Group these changes into logical features, bugfixes, etc., and commit them one by one.

**Procedure (from GEMINI.md):**
1.  **Analyze Changes:**
    - Use `git status` and `git diff` to identify all modified and untracked files.
    - Group files that are related to a single logical change (e.g., feature, tests, docs).
2.  **Proposal:**
    - Present the proposed commit groups and their commit messages to me for approval.
    - Use Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
    - Use the `ask_user` to confirm with the user before proceeding with the commits (simple yes/no dialog).
3.  **Execution:**
    - After confirmation, for each group:
        a. Stage the files.
        b. Commit with the proposed message.
    - Report the successful commits.

If there are no changes to commit, let me know.
