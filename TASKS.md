# Tasks

Legend:

- [ ] Todo
- [/] In Progress (@user) <-- indicates who is doing it
- [x] Done

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Keep task descriptions short but descriptive. Do not add implementation details, those belong in task-specific plans. When adding new tasks, consider grouping them into meaningful clusters such as UX, Backend, Logic, Refactoring, etc.

Put done tasks into the Archive.
